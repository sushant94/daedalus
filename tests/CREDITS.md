# Credits for test files

Some of the test files used in this framework are not the work of the authors. Hence, this file is to credit the original creators of these files. Many of these have been part of various CTFs and this is an effort to acknowledge their authorships. If you have any problem with the use of these files, please contact me and I'll be more than happy to remove them.
